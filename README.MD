## Project Overview

Binary Run is built using the **Godot Engine**, a powerful open-source game engine. It features modular, scene-based designs, making it easy to modify or extend. The game is intended for students and educators who want a fun, interactive way to explore the basics of the binary number system.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand binary numbers and
- Develop an understanding of converting binary to decimal and vice versa

---

## Features

- **Educational Gameplay**: Teaches the key computer science concept of binary in a fun and interactive way.
- **Modular Design**: Game structure allows easy modifications and expansions.
- **Visual Learning**: Simple visual style in order to provide a game that anyone can understand.
- **Cross-Platform**: Can be run on Windows, Linux, and macOS through the Godot Engine.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

Binary Run.exe - Pre-compiled executable that runs the game 

Binary Run/ - Root directory for the Godot project files 

Binary Run/assets/ - Contains all game assets including music, sprites, and models

Binary Run/modules - Contains scenes and scripts for the two modules used in the game

Binary Run/scenes - Contains all scenes used within the project



### Detailed Breakdown:

- **Binary Run.exe**: This is the pre-compiled executable file that runs the game. You can directly run this file to play the game without editing the code.
- **Binary Run/**: The root directory for all project files, including the Godot project and source code.
- **assets/**: Contains all the visual and audio assets for the game, such as sprites, models, textures, and soundtracks.
- **modules/**: This directory contains the two primary modules (or levels) of the game, each designed to teach different CS concepts. The scripts and scenes for each module are housed here.
- **scenes/**: Houses all the core scenes of the game, such as the main menu, settings, and levels.
